        <h2>Description</h2> <!-- Paragraph or two describing the recipe -->
            <p>If you're looking for the best French toast recipe on the internet, you've come to the right place. This tender, fluffy, and indulgent recipe come together quickly and easily with just five ingredients you already have on hand. How do you know it's good? Because this deliciously easy recipe has earned nearly 2,000 rave reviews from the Allrecipes community.</p>
            <p>The best breads for French toast are brioche, sourdough, French bread, or challah. These varieties are dense and sturdy enough to handle total saturation in the wet, milky, egg custard without falling apart. However, in a pinch, any thick-sliced white bread will do. French toast is traditionally made with day-old slices because they absorb the eggy mixture better than fresh ones (and this method prevents waste, it's a win-win). Of course, a slightly stale loaf is certainly not a requirement. If you only have fresh bread on hand, that'll work just fine.</p>
